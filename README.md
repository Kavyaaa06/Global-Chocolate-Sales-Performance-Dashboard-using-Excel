# Global-Chocolate-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-using-Excel
This project showcases a visually rich sales performance dashboard created in Microsoft Excel to analyze global chocolate sales data. It provides a detailed overview of salesperson contributions, product-wise shipment trends, and country-wise sales distribution. With the use of bar, pie, and line charts, the dashboard presents monthly comparisons and region-specific insights for better strategic planning.

The dashboard is built using key Excel tools like pivot tables, slicers, data bars, conditional formatting, and advanced charts to enhance data analysis.
